ðŸ”µ Add <b><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python</a></b> and <b><a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a></b> to your System PATH.

ðŸ”µ Using a <a href="https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/master/help_docs/virtualenv_instructions.md">Python virtual env</a> is recommended.

### Install the dependencies
After setting up python and a virtual environment you can install the requirements via `requirements.txt`
